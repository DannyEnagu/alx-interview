# 0x00. Pascal's Triangle

Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers. It starts with a row containing only the number 1, and each subsequent row is constructed by adding adjacent numbers in the row above.

Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The numbers at the edges of the triangle (the ones on the sides) are always 1 because there is no number above them to add. In each row, the number of elements is equal to the row number.
